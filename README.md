# Context API + State Storage

## Deployed Site:
https://context-api-with-storage-options.surge.sh/

## Overview: 

Quick example of using context API for passing state to a child component.

Also, has 3 different ways of storing the state:

- useState hook by itself (Data doesn't persist when user refreshes the browser)
- Local Storage (Allows the data to persist )
- Session Storage (Also allows the data to persist)

(Original code is from https://codesandbox.io/s/context-api-solution-2y0cu. I modified it by adding a form and storage options.)
